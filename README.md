Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS) is an open-source library that allows developers to: 
- Search for similar embeddings in multimedia documents
- Cluster dense vectors
- Build an index and perform searches quickly and efficiently
- Find visually similar images or semantically similar text within a large dataset
- FAISS is implemented in C++
- Algorithms that search in sets of vectors of any size
- Supporting code for evaluation and parameter tuning
- Methods that use a compressed representation of the vectors
- Methods that add an indexing structure on top of the raw vectors
- You can index a set of vectors using FAISS, and then search for the most similar vectors within the index using another vector.
